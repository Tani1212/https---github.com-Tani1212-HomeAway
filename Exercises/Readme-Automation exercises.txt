For Re-creating Test Environment
>Go to Microsoft visual studio> Open Test Explorer> Run All test cases.

Notes:  
1.	Given comments in code for each functionality.
2.	For validating updated Account details- Not able to register to my account (didn’t get email with password, seems to be an issue with smtp service.)
3.	Submit order loops through same page, so cannot automate that.

API tests for https://api.data.gov/
> Used Selenium, c# for test framework.
> Specified JSON as the output format

For Re-creating Test Environment
